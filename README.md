# Runtime Behavior Steering for Safe Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a normative supervisor which augments the actions of a pretrained DQN agent to enforce driving norms and safety constraints. The agent is trained and tested in the [HighwayEnv](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/HighwayEnv/tree/master) simulation environment using the configurations under the `configs/` directory.

## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1. Prerequisites

- `python >= 3.9`
- `virtualenv` (recommended)

### 1.2. Installation

```bash

## 3. Usage

### 3.1. Training Models

```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

Select training and environment configurations when prompted.

### 3.2. Running Experiments

```bash
python scripts/test.py
```

Choose models, environment configurations, and supervision parameters. Results of the test are written to `results/` by default. Use `--help` to read all of the command-line options.

### 3.3. Analyzing Results

```bash
python scripts/analyze_results.py
```

Processes CSV files in `results/` to generate summary statistics, which are written to `analysis/` by default. Use `--help` to read all of the command-line options.
